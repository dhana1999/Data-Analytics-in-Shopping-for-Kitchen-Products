PROBLEM STATEMENT
We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even knowing it.
For eg : Going to a market to buy something .
Plan:
We first decide which things I need before going to market . Is it a shirt , jeans , footwear etc.
Prepare:
Next I need to check how much I am willing to spend and how to get that money.
Process:
Then I need to check how much I want from the data. Like if I am going to buy footwear what do I want - slippers / shoes / sandals etc.
Analyze:
You obviously won't buy things which are out of trend, Also you need to check does the jeans which you have and the color of t-shirt you want to buy, will it make a good combination.
Share:
Now you communicate your idea to the shopkeeper to find the best suitable fit for you.
Act:
Then you finally buy it!
